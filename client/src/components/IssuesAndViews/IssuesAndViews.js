        In many parts of India, the birth of a girl child is not welcomed. Right
        from her arrival, she faces discrimination, humiliation, and oppression
        at every stage of life. When it comes to healthcare, education and
        growth opportunities, she is neglected because of her gender. Some
        manage to survive and foster new paths to follow. Most, however,
        surrender hopelessly to the sad fate assigned to them.

        In a country rife with gender inequalities and an underlying nature of
        patriarchy, girl children often find themselves at the short end of the
        stick. Discrimination against girls is rampant and due to the fear of
        abuse and exploitation, they are kept at home and not sent to school.
        Child marriage is yet another glaring issue due to which girls are
        forced to give up going to school at an early age.

        The issue of girl child rights and protection in India is a very serious
        concern. Being home to more than one third of the 10 million child
        brides in the world, India has one of the highest numbers of girls
        forced into marriage before the legal age of 18. If one half of our
        society remain so vulnerable to violence and neglect, how will the
        country advance or progress? Not only are they unsafe at home where they
        are victims of stereotypical attitude, but also in learning
        environments. Ill-equipped schools that lack separate toilets for girls
        are one of the major deterrents for parents not willing to send their
        girls to study. The few who manage to attend school risk violence and
        abuse. According to India’s 2011 census, 53% households and 11% schools
        had no toilets. This lack of safety deprives young girls of an
        opportunity to educate themselves and better their lives.

        In order to make sure that girl children get access to quality
        education, we need to tackle the mindset that makes it okay for young
        children to be employed. Girl Child Rights are being aggressively
        advocated in the country by individuals, governmental organisations and
        many NGOs.

        We want to be part of a world where girls are celebrated. Where they are
        treated equally, with love and respect. What is urgently required in
        society today is a change of attitude. Girls must be given the same
        opportunities and protection as boys, and must be treated at par. A
        girl’s childhood can and must be preserved, cherished, nurtured and
        protected. Because she has the right to survive, develop, be protected
        and participate in decisions that impact her life
